    <p class="quote ">" "Hideaway" Take me anywhere you want to go You know that my love is strong in my hideaway Softly like the calm that follows storm Find what I 've been searching for, all along in my hideaway

Even when I close my eyes darling
I will always stay wide awake in my hideaway

Touch me
Like I've never loved before In a place that I adore In my hideaway I know Whichever way the wind may blow There will be a place for me to go In my hideaway Whether you be lost of found Darling, if you 've gone astray
I'm on my way To my hideaway My hideaway Down going down Down falling down Down goin down Follow down When the rain falls Falling down to the sea Flow that river To the depth of me Let me Feel the sky and feel the moon Let me sing an honest tune To
        my hideaway Trusting Wherever I go wandering I 'll find a home in everything
In my hideaway
Maybe you can come to stay
And I will meet you here someday
Far away
In my hideaway
